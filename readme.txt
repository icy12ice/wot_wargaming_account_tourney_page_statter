* These scripts assume you already have either greasemonkey or tampermonkey installed in your respective browser of choice *

This is just a tweaked version of the forum statter I wrote, so that I can see stats on the user pages on wargaming's main site as well as seeing everyone's stats on tourney teams. This makes evaluating the teams you're playing against and teams you might plan on joining much easier to look at stats-wise.

There are only slight changes between the tampermonkey and greasemonkey versions, basically in the way it recognizes which pages to run on. If you just add the tampermonkey script to Chrome, should just work, but you'll need to set your websites to run the script on in greasemonkey (which you can pretty much just copy and paste from the @match in the tampermonkey script.

Anyways, enjoy!
